# Summer blues // Mission 3-1

The squad heads out through the jungles to investigate the first crash site. The jungle is thick and the mechs have to move through the upper canopy. Below they can see Subalterns wandering aimlessly.

The squad spots the ship and is able to determine that it is a small sunlight scout vessel. It's been landed fairly well considering it's not designed for atmosphere. **Jeremiah**  is able to spot someone hiding on the top of the craft away from subalterns below. Through some luck he is able to contact the man but slips on his words and a fight breaks out. 

**OKHOTNIK** charges into a **PYRO** frame as **RASBERRY THURSDAY** clears of several **GRUNT BERSERKERS** and **AUFHEBEN** wipes out several swarms of subalterns. A **SCOURER** barely missed  **RASBERRY THURSDAY** as the drop to all fours following the advice of **MAAHINEN**.

A ping arrives from a source going by the name **THE HERALD**. ‘Notice: You may still surrender /// If not missile will arrive in [[30]] seconds’.  The old Sec Com frame opens with a barrage of cluster missiles. **OKHOTNIK** is able to jet up to the spacecraft, making sure the pilot is safe. **MAAHINEN** shoots down a large missile with the signature **NOTICE** with one round of rifle shots. Again **RASBERRY THURSDAY** clears of several **GRUNT BERSERKERS**. **AUFHEBEN** is able to torch the **THE HERALD**, unable to escape from the plasma talon's grip.
