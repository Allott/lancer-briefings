# Early Spring // Mission 1-1

As the squad awake from their months long stasiss and set their sights on the planet known as **Hercynia**. The NHP **Consejera** runs them through post stasis proceedure. **Captain Beck offers** them cocktails and give them bad new on the landing. **Commander Dyatlov** Breifs them on the mission ahead. 

As they approach the world, their ship’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure, and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by local flightcomm. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planetwide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **Brava Hadura** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.

After making it to **Evergreen**, Brava get the exited 10 year old **Sean** to tour them around time. First they talk to the **Dr. Marricado** the local biologist. Then to cheif engineer **Castor Fielding**.

Finally the group meets with colonial admin **Patience** and attaché **Edena Ji** to discuss the mission breifing. The squad discusses the potential nature of the threat and assesses that going after the sniper is  the better target.

# Early Spring // Mission 1-2

Waking up to some questionable wallnuts, the squad get breakfast from **Bottom of the wells** keeper **Mir Bahadur**. Delivering booze on the way, they meet up with **Castor** and setup the mechs. 

Moving to assult the sniper, The forest is thick and drenched in rain. Sucking mud pulls at you and your mech as you push forward through vines and tree trunks shrouded in fog. The path was clear, the sniper easy to track. **VEMON** trap goes off perfectly. Shots flying out and majorly damaging **Green Fjord**. A squad of buglike men, ambush **RBMK** but they deftly brace and fire back. **Einherjar** crushes a support under their huge blade and **MAAHINEN** Guns down and captures the spotter in one barrage. With **Vemons** allys down, the two sagarmatha titans surround them, stunning and then crushing them in a swift maneuver.

The captured pilots dont speak much union common. The pilot of **VEMON** negotiated to free their partner. The crew savlaged what the could and headed back to evergreen. On the way **Edena Ji** called them on unoffical buisness. They could not recognise the greytown farms as existing officially but tiped of the squad that unusual signals had been picked up in "unoccupied" farm territory. The squad plan to check them out after dropping off the hostage and repairing mechs.

Getting back into town, the catchup with **Brava Hadura** and the militia. They managed to fight off enemy chassis from the landing bowl. However disaster struck when an IED exploded in the pump house, badly injuring many. Kyrie immediately jumped to help the injured, but faced off against **Tyrell Markey** who was jelous of Lancers taking all the glory. After a brief conversation with **Castor Fielding** the crew set of the chase after "the rest of them heading south".
