# Early Spring // Mission 1-1

As the squad awake from their months long stasiss and set their sights on the planet known as **Hercynia**. The NHP **Consejera** runs them through post stasis proceedure. **Captain Beck offers** them cocktails and give them bad new on the landing. **Commander Dyatlov** Breifs them on the mission ahead. 

As they approach the world, their ship’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure, and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by local flightcomm. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planetwide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **Brava Hadura** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.

After making it to **Evergreen**, Brava get the exited 10 year old **Sean** to tour them around time. First they talk to the **Dr. Marricado** the local biologist. Then to cheif engineer **Castor Fielding**.

Finally the group meets with colonial admin **Patience** and attaché **Edena Ji** to discuss the mission breifing. The squad discusses the potential nature of the threat and assesses that going after the sniper is  the better target.
