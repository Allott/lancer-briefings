# Early Spring // Mission 1-1

As the squad awake from their months long statics and set their sights on the planet known as **Hercynia**. The NHP **Consejera** runs them through post stasis procedure. **Captain Beck offers** them cocktails and give them bad news on the landing. **Commander Dyatlov** Breifs them on the mission ahead. 

As they approach the world, their ship’s SIGINT deck reports that Hercynia is throwing off an incredible amount of noise – likely because it is a post-collapse SecComm “punching bag” world littered with old, decaying military infrastructure, and ruins – and they find themselves unable to get clear signals. All of this matches the thin profile pushed to them by local flightcomm. Unfortunately, optics are shot as well. Hercynia appears to be socked in under a planet wide monsoon season, blanketing all but the most extreme poles with thick cloud cover.

The squad lands safely, dismounts from the shuttle, and begins assembling their gear as a small group approaches the shuttle. The group introduces themselves as a militia, with **Brava Hadura** as their Commander. She quickly informs them to get moving – and stay low, as there's a sniper in the area. The shuttle then begins its automated launch sequence, only to return a year from now.

After making it to **Evergreen**, Brava get the exited 10 year old **Sean** to tour them around time. First they talk to the **Dr. Marricado** the local biologist. Then to chief engineer **Castor Fielding**.

Finally the group meets with colonial admin **Patience** and attaché **Edena Ji** to discuss the mission briefing. The squad discusses the potential nature of the threat and assesses that going after the sniper is  the better target.

# Early Spring // Mission 1-2

Waking up to some questionable walnuts, the squad get breakfast from **Bottom of the wells** keeper **Mir Bahadur**. Delivering booze on the way, they meet up with **Castor** and set up the mechs. 

Moving to assault the sniper, The forest is thick and drenched in rain. Sucking mud pulls at you and your mech as you push forward through vines and tree trunks shrouded in fog. The path was clear, the sniper easy to track. **VEMON’S** trap goes off perfectly. Shots flying out and majorly damaging **GREEN FJORD**. A squad of buglike men, ambush **RBMK** but they deftly brace and fire back. **EINHERJAR** crushes a support under their huge blade and **MAAHINEN** Guns down and captures the spotter in one barrage. With **VEMON** ally's down, the two sagarmatha titans surround them, stunning and then crushing them in a swift maneuver.

The captured pilots dont speak much union common. The pilot of **VEMON** negotiated to free their partner. The squad salvaged what they could and headed back to evergreen. On the way **Edena Ji** called them on unofficial business. They could not recognise the greytown farms as existing officially but tipped off the squad that unusual signals had been picked up in "unoccupied" farm territory. The squad plan to check them out after dropping off the hostage and repairing mechs.

Getting back into town, the catchup with **Brava Hadura** and the militia. They managed to fight off enemy chassis from the landing bowl. However disaster struck when an IED exploded in the pump house, badly injuring many. Kyrie immediately jumped to help the injured, but faced off against **Tyrell Markey** who was jealous of Lancers taking all the glory. After a brief conversation with **Castor Fielding** the squad set off the chase after "the rest of them heading south".

# Early Spring // Mission 1-3

Following **Edena Ji** lead, the squad make their way to Liu Maize. As they travel the road between rice paddies, they spot groups of subalterns making their way south. Some of which crawled while crippled, with no sense of their own preservation. Following along, they find their way to the burning farms of the Chau. The immediately get a distress call from **Albert Châu**, who is trapped inside a burning barn along with his family. They need rescue from rogue subalterns.

Moving to the farm, the squad move and spot a frame going by the callsign **THE BROADCAST** along with its squad of old SecCom mechs and repurposed farming equipment. **THE BROADCAST** unleashes its **TERRORTHRONE** a powerful tech attack system blocking the reduction of heat. **RBMK** unleashes an early mortar strike for massive damage. As the squad advances more mechs rise from swarms of subalterns. One berserks into **MAAHINEN** for massive damage. **EINHERJAR** eventually advances right up next to **THE BROADCAST** and activates her core power **RALLYING CRY**. **EINHERJAR** takes blast after blast of laz fire, hitting back with huge charge blade blows. Using the opening presented, the rest of the squad moved up and take positions to take out the **SCOURER** class frames. **MAAHINEN** Snipes some major blows and **GREEN FJORD** presents enough rapid fire to finish them both off. **EINHERJAR** eventually cleaves **THE BROADCAST** with **RBMK** rescues the civilians.

When they investigate, the mech where all mysteriously empty, all except **THE BROADCAST** which contained a subaltern dressed in military regalia. They were able to pull off an AI core from the wreck. The squad take about the nature of the enemy while taking the **Châu** family over to **Liu Maize**. When they get there they find the small wooden town filled with farmers who have been harassed by rouge subalterns. The mayor **Mr Beaver** meets with the squad and they exchange stories. It's been known for subalterns to go on weird seasons like this one but never to this extreme. 

# Early Spring // Downtime

Having stabilize the situation around **Evergreen** and pushed back the pirates, the squad had a quite few weeks of downtime.

**Jeremiah** and **Andreus** between them salvaged and restored a **GENGHIS MK 1 WORLDKILLER**

**Niklas** and **Jeremiah** spent some time learning about the local enviroment and fauna with **Dr. Marricado**

**Niklas** was shown around time by the kid **Sean**. They where found at the hospital waiting to see there previously paralyzed mother. **Sean** had not been sleeping at home, instead living out of his secret base an old organically carved tunnel below the depot district.

**Kyriea** worked for **Lunvilla** evergreens head baker at the ever crowded shop **the Block**. 

**Andreus** and **Kyriea** began to train and organise a small group of the local militia, **Sgt. Fizgerald's Bolts**. A squad of older evergreen born volunteers, most of which are getting up in the years. The squad has been trained to man a tracked APC, and have spent the last year running supplies.
