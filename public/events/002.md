# Late Spring // Mission 1-2

Contact on the south gate. They are here.

Getting up in a hurry the squad defends the south gate. Prefabricated barricades and defensive emplacements have recently been constructed around the outer perimeter of Evergreen. Trees have been cut to provide sitelines. But the walls are already being bombarded. 

The HUC BOMBARD shells the squad with cluster bombs, it out ranges them. **AZYR** and **EINHERJAR** advance and boost through the gates. STRIDER class Frames advances forward and exchanges fire with millitias **BOLTS APC** and **BONGO FIVE** all missing. Following **Andreus's** orders, **MAAHEIN** fires **STING** straight into and through the **STRIDER** who regognized the gun for only a moment.

More HUC reinforcements arrive and engage. An **ARCHER** attempts to suppress **AZYR** but cannot get through its armor, its blinding shells dim compared to the flames of the Theromobaric Flamethrower. **EINHERJAR** charges a **STRIDER** but fumbles, the **STRIDER** unleashing its explosive rifle.

**EINHERJAR** snipes another **STRIDER** with string, but draws the attention of a **SPECTER**. The **SPECTER** blinks behind **EINHERJAR** dealing massive damage. **BONGO FIVE** invades with **BALANCE CONTROL LOCK**, forcing the **SPECTER** off the edge of the wall away from **EINHERJAR**. As the **SPECTER** falls Hunter lock activates and the smart gun shoots the **SPECTER** to shreads.

The Ranger forces start to retreat as the squad advance on the bombard, **AZYR** venting fire on any that remain. But as the all clear is called a priority message is sent. The Reactor perimmiter has been breached.
