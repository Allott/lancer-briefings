# Late Spring // Mission 2-1

Contact on the south gate. They are here.

Getting up in a hurry the squad defends the south gate. Prefabricated barricades and defensive emplacements have recently been constructed around the outer perimeter of Evergreen. Trees have been cut to provide sitelines. But the walls are already being bombarded. 

The HUC BOMBARD shells the squad with cluster bombs, it out ranges them. **AZYR** and **EINHERJAR** advance and boost through the gates. STRIDER class Frames advances forward and exchanges fire with millitias **BOLTS APC** and **BONGO FIVE** all missing. Following **Andreus's** orders, **MAAHEIN** fires **STING** straight into and through the **STRIDER** who recognise the gun for only a moment.

More HUC reinforcements arrive and engage. An **ARCHER** attempts to suppress **AZYR** but cannot get through its armor, its blinding shells dim compared to the flames of the Theromobaric Flamethrower. **EINHERJAR** charges a **STRIDER** but fumbles, the **STRIDER** unleashing its explosive rifle.

**EINHERJAR** snipes another **STRIDER** with **STING**, but draws the attention of a **SPECTER**. The **SPECTER** blinks behind **MAAHINEN** dealing massive damage. **BONGO FIVE** invades with **BALANCE CONTROL LOCK**, forcing the **SPECTER** off the edge of the wall away from **EINHERJAR**. As the **SPECTER** falls Hunter lock activates and the smart gun shoots the **SPECTER** to shreads.

The Ranger forces start to retreat as the squad advance on the bombard, **AZYR** venting fire on any that remain. But as the all clear is called a priority message is sent. The Reactor perimeter has been breached. 

# Late Spring // Mission 2-2

After rendezvousing with a barge the squad travels east to the reactor plant. **STRELOK** and **BEARHOG** are able to hotwire a mech reactor into the barge, speeding it up. 

Arriving at the plant it has already taken a lot of damage, only one power regulator remains. Two power regulators had already been crushed under the hammer of the **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER**. 

**BONGO FIVE** opened with a **WIDE-AREA CODE PULSE** repositioning the majority of the Ranger forces. As the squad rush over the gate of the reactor **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** moves over to the final power regulators. **AZYR** advances burning through both enemy **RONIN** and his allies, but is knocked back by the explosive rifle of a **STRIDER**. 

The **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** managed a critical blow against the power regulator but it held on. Sensing it's make or break, **BONGO FIVE** jets forwards using a pair of overcharged **INVADES** to move the **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** away, exposing themselves in the process. 

**EINHERJAR** activates rallying cry protecting the exposed **BONGO FIVE** from charging  **RONIN** and an explosive rifle shot. **AZYR** charges the **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** countering their defenses with **TBK MUNITIONS** and **FURIOSA**, stacking up horrendous amounts of burn. **MAAHINEN** having advanced to the main roof has a vantage point over the entire area, and after taking some mortar fire is able to snipe off remaining **STRIDERS**.

With militia forces arriving at the reactors it is quickly secured, Remaining ranger forces surrendering. However during the fight the siege picked up back at Evergreen tracer fire once again lighting up the night.

While heading back upriver on the barge the squad gets a hail from an old frequency. Answering cautiously they speak with **DTHALL ORDO** a leader of ‘some of the rangers’. **DTHALL** drops the coordinates of something to help. When asked why she says that this attack was a waste of time and innocent lives.

Getting the barge driver **J Johnson** to pull onto the eastern bank the squad approaches the coordinates. There they find a lone **SSC SWALLOWTAIL** projecting the plans for a huge volatile mech **REGRET**. **REGRET** is a late Secom design and its reactor is heavily overclocked and is set to self destruct unless stopped. The **SSC SWALLOWTAIL** however is a lot as old, being a relatively modern design that has been maintained manually.
