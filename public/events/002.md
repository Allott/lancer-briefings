# Late Spring // Mission 2-1

Contact on the south gate. They are here.

Getting up in a hurry the squad defends the south gate. Prefabricated barricades and defensive emplacements have recently been constructed around the outer perimeter of Evergreen. Trees have been cut to provide sitelines. But the walls are already being bombarded. 

The HUC BOMBARD shells the squad with cluster bombs, it out ranges them. **AZYR** and **EINHERJAR** advance and boost through the gates. STRIDER class Frames advances forward and exchanges fire with millitias **BOLTS APC** and **BONGO FIVE** all missing. Following **Andreus's** orders, **MAAHEIN** fires **STING** straight into and through the **STRIDER** who recognise the gun for only a moment.

More HUC reinforcements arrive and engage. An **ARCHER** attempts to suppress **AZYR** but cannot get through its armor, its blinding shells dim compared to the flames of the Theromobaric Flamethrower. **EINHERJAR** charges a **STRIDER** but fumbles, the **STRIDER** unleashing its explosive rifle.

**EINHERJAR** snipes another **STRIDER** with **STING**, but draws the attention of a **SPECTER**. The **SPECTER** blinks behind **MAAHINEN** dealing massive damage. **BONGO FIVE** invades with **BALANCE CONTROL LOCK**, forcing the **SPECTER** off the edge of the wall away from **EINHERJAR**. As the **SPECTER** falls Hunter lock activates and the smart gun shoots the **SPECTER** to shreads.

The Ranger forces start to retreat as the squad advance on the bombard, **AZYR** venting fire on any that remain. But as the all clear is called a priority message is sent. The Reactor perimeter has been breached. 

# Late Spring // Mission 2-2

After rendezvousing with a barge the squad travels east to the reactor plant. **STRELOK** and **BEARHOG** are able to hotwire a mech reactor into the barge, speeding it up. 

Arriving at the plant it has already taken a lot of damage, only one power regulator remains. Two power regulators had already been crushed under the hammer of the **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER**. 

**BONGO FIVE** opened with a **WIDE-AREA CODE PULSE** repositioning the majority of the Ranger forces. As the squad rush over the gate of the reactor **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** moves over to the final power regulators. **AZYR** advances burning through both enemy **RONIN** and his allies, but is knocked back by the explosive rifle of a **STRIDER**. 

The **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** managed a critical blow against the power regulator but it held on. Sensing it's make or break, **BONGO FIVE** jets forwards using a pair of overcharged **INVADES** to move the **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** away, exposing themselves in the process. 

**EINHERJAR** activates rallying cry protecting the exposed **BONGO FIVE** from charging  **RONIN** and an explosive rifle shot. **AZYR** charges the **DEMOLISHER COMMANDER** countering their defenses with **TBK MUNITIONS** and **FURIOSA**, stacking up horrendous amounts of burn. **MAAHINEN** having advanced to the main roof has a vantage point over the entire area, and after taking some mortar fire is able to snipe off remaining **STRIDERS**.

With militia forces arriving at the reactors it is quickly secured, Remaining ranger forces surrendering. However during the fight the siege picked up back at Evergreen tracer fire once again lighting up the night.

While heading back upriver on the barge the squad gets a hail from an old frequency. Answering cautiously they speak with **DTHALL ORDO** a leader of ‘some of the rangers’. **DTHALL** drops the coordinates of something to help. When asked why she says that this attack was a waste of time and innocent lives.

Getting the barge driver **J Johnson** to pull onto the eastern bank the squad approaches the coordinates. There they find a lone **SSC SWALLOWTAIL** projecting the plans for a huge volatile mech **REGRET**. **REGRET** is a late Secom design and its reactor is heavily overclocked and is set to self destruct unless stopped. The **SSC SWALLOWTAIL** however is a lot as old, being a relatively modern design that has been maintained manually. 

# Late Spring // Mission 2-2

The squad rush to defend against **REGRET** and it's a terror attack. The nearby buildings are populated with sheltering civilians. **Strelok** sets their watch, 6 minutes until meltdown.

## 6
 **BONGO FIVE** and **MAAHINEN** advance up each flank synchronously taking out each **PYRO**. **AZYR** takes point and engages **REGRET** head on, but the titan is able to pick them up and push forward, blasting flames in all directions. 

## 5
**BONGO FIVE** moves to engage the surprisingly elite **SUPPORT**. **EINHERJAR** drops down onto **REGRET** who is now flanked. **REGRET** fails to do any meaningful damage as  **EINHERJAR** slices of it Hellfire Projector and **AZYR** show it a better one. 

## 4
Force to retreat and having taken critical damage **REGRET** is forced to retreat. It knocks back **AZYR** and in the shroud of napalm ascends a nearby building. **MAAHINEN** having set up prior snipes with **STING** for major damage. 

## 3
**BONGO FIVE** is chased by **REGRET** from roof to roof. In a desperate attempt to ground them **AZYR** overcharges and, **CYNOSURE** is activated. Successfully mesmerizing **REGRET**, It charges **AZYR** crushing the exposed mech in one blow.

## 2
Mounting once final stand **EINHERJAR** attempts to hold **REGRET** still so that **MAAHINEN** can snipe them cleanly. **MAAHINEN** leaps from roof top to roof as **EINHERJAR** successfully endures. But in the final moments **REGRET** gains control, **MAAHINEN** lands a glancing blow as **EINHERJAR** is dragged scraping up the streets. 

## 1
With no time left, **Kyrie** activates self destruct and ejects towards **REGRET**. **MAAHINEN** and **BONGO FIVE** engage with what they have left before being forced to retreat. As the final seconds tick in the empty cockpit of **AZYR** tick, all that can be seen is  **Kyrie** attempting to rip open the exposed cockpit of **REGRET**.

In a flash the western residential districts that had taken half a generation to build ceased to exist. The long night ended as a spilled bucket of sunshine burnt hopes and blinded onlookers. Then the windows shattered, then hot winds roared. And then, only then after the long short night, were the people of evergreen greeted by the cruel dawn of the world they now lived in. Exposed.
