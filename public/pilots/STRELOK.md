Andreus comes from an older colony world called Ushoryagrad. As far as homes go, it wasn't a terrible one, so long as you could put up with the 8-month rainy season. Ushoryagrad is a world of two suns, dense evergreen forests, mountains, and coal-sand beaches; night time was short, and summer even shorter. Just watch out for the cave reptiles and you're golden.

Before he was a pilot, Andreus worked as a planning officer with the forestry commission. He lead a team of tree surgeons and construction workers who harvested the forests for raw materials that the colonists used for building and shipping offworld. He became a pilot because he eventually realised there was no way up from where he was, and that he felt he had finally outgrown his homeworld.
