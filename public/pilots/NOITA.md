Nikk is originally from a Hycean (word combo with Hydrogen and Ocean) class planet on a twin star system, called Mas-E V. Planets classification refers to the fact of it being far from what is usually considered the "habitable zone" for such system, and is thus largely frozen over. However due to atmosphere, some pools of even surface liquid water exists on the planet. Its core heat can't escape as easily with the insulation caused by the gases. 

Mas-E V is large for a rocky planet located near a galactic intersection and is rich in rare minerals used in printing materials, so it has lively, permanent human colony safely tucked underground due the inhospitable conditions outside. Niklas started feeling the pull of the stars rather early on in his life, and hopped on first chance he got to haul both on-planet and interplanetary cargo in his home system.
