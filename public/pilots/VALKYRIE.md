Ky was born and raised on the Valhalla-II, an isolated and aged colony ship converted over generations into a stationary colony on the far orbit of the agricultural world Midgarde of which the Valhalla-II was designed to populate. The colony was relatively conservative, living a lifestyle of necessity and regular work for all able-bodied residents starting at a young age, bearing the burden of being the “protectors” of the planet below, while rarely actually interacting with its residents.

A still-unidentified force brought total ruin to Midgarde when Ky was little more than a child, and the Valhalla-II was caught completely unprepared, itself succumbing to the attack swiftly and brutally. Ky survived some time in the wreckage of the station before managing to repair and launch one of the evacuation pods, later being picked up by Union forces.
