Toor is and industrialised world sitting at a nexus point between several relatively close by colonies, a far flung group of humanity amongst the stars that is lucky enough to justify having a gate in relative proximity. As a union aligned, but not yet union member state it makes its commerce by producing advanced machinery that more basic industrial bases cannot, and exports them to local worlds.

Culturaly its not dissimilar to a frontier world, with a few core cities, and a tangled web of planetoid maining colonies and belt-stations from the systems numerous asteroid belts, spreading its population across the entire star-system.

The planet at the time was suffering from a major ecological disaster as a collector of off-planet species had released his collection shortly before his death, and a lax, uninterested law enforcement failed to investigate before they had propagated.

Furthermore despite being union aligned, the local government was strunggling with reigning in the local corporations, leading to background power struggle between the ultra-wealthy and the government. Leading to relatively lax workers rights and poor oversight to corporate activites. The new (union aligned) teeth of the government had at least caused the corporations to significantly increase QOL for their workers shortly before Jeremiah entered the workforce.

It is safe to say that the planet only narrowly avoided condemning itself to a dystopian future.

Jeremiah would likely not recognise Toor and its star-system if he returned to it now, significant time has passed, and many of the issues he knew of have likely been resolved.
